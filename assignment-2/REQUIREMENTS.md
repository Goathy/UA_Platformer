The aim of this task is to go through the material on [how to build your own Super Mario clone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gLeplbqtqg) until you draw a red square symbolising the player.

Modify the code to paint a character instead of this red square.
You need to load a PNG (e.g. in the player builder) and paint it instead of drawing a square.

Do not draw the background.

Only two files need to be uploaded: the code and the used graphic for the player.

The graphics are to be loaded from the current folder. (No hardcoded paths).
