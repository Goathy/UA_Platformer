Usually when the player moves the scenery also moves (so not the background but the objects with which the player can interact).

Here's a very nice (complete) [resource where the looped background scrolls in one direction](https://www.askpython.com/python-modules/pygame-looping-background).

Modify the code above to draw the player roughly in the middle.
Use two images - player facing right or left.
Add arrow controls so that the player rotates in the indicated direction and the background scrolls accordingly.

Perhaps the player should be a vehicle? (Motorbike, car, plane, rocket, ...).

Upload code and graphics - player facing right, player facing left and background.
