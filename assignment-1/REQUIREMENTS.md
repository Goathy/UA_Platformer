The aim of this task is to go through the material on [how to build your own Super Mario clone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gLeplbqtqg), up to the point where you draw a window in which you can see the background (made up of 'tiles', i.e. a small graphic reproduced many times).

Only two files need to be uploaded: the code and the graphic used.

The graphics are to be loaded from the current folder. (No hardcoded paths).
